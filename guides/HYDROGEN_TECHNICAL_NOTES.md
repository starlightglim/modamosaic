# Hydrogen Technical Considerations

## Hydrogen 2.0 Framework

Hydrogen is Shopify's React-based framework for building custom storefronts. The current codebase is using Hydrogen 2.0, which is built on Remix and provides a modern, performant approach to building Shopify storefronts.

## Key Technical Considerations

### 1. Remix-Based Architecture
- Hydrogen 2.0 is built on Remix, using its nested routing and data loading patterns
- Uses file-based routing in the `app/routes` directory
- Leverages Remix's loader and action patterns for data fetching and mutations

### 2. Data Fetching
- Use the Storefront API (GraphQL) for all Shopify data
- Implement proper data caching strategies using Remix's cache control
- Utilize the `useLoaderData` hook for component data access
- Consider implementing stale-while-revalidate patterns for dynamic data

### 3. Multi-Creator Specific Considerations
- Store creator configuration in Shopify metafields or as custom collections/products
- Use dynamic parameters in routes for creator handles: `/creators/[handle]`
- Implement proper access control for creator-specific data
- Consider server components for creator-specific rendering

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Implement proper code splitting, especially for creator-specific code
- Use streaming for large data loads
- Implement proper image optimization using Shopify's CDN
- Consider edge rendering for globally distributed creators/customers

### 5. SEO and Discoverability
- Implement proper meta tags for each creator's products
- Set up structured data for rich results
- Configure proper canonical URLs for creator products
- Implement sitemaps that include all creator pages

### 6. Asset Management
- Organize assets logically between global and creator-specific
- Implement proper loading strategies for creator-specific assets
- Consider using Shopify's CDN for creator assets where possible

### 7. Authentication and User Management
- Leverage Shopify Customer Accounts for user management
- Implement proper session handling for creator logins
- Set up appropriate access controls between creators

### 8. Common Hydrogen Patterns to Follow
- Use the `<Await>` component for deferred data loading
- Leverage Remix's error boundary system
- Implement proper form handling using Remix's Form component
- Use Suspense boundaries appropriately for loading states

## Development Workflow

1. Use `npm run dev` for local development
2. Test with real Shopify data using proper environment variables
3. Leverage the Hydrogen CLI tools for scaffolding and generation
4. Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase

## Deployment Considerations

- Deploy to Oxygen (Shopify's hosting platform) for best integration
- Set up proper environment variables for production
- Implement proper error monitoring and logging
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout of creator features
