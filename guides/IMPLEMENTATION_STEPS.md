# ModaMosaic Implementation Steps

This document outlines the step-by-step process to adapt the current Hydrogen template to the ModaMosaic multi-creator marketplace structure.

## Phase 1: Directory Structure Setup

### Step 1: Reorganize Components Directory
```bash
# Create new component directories
mkdir -p app/components/global
mkdir -p app/components/product
mkdir -p app/components/ui

# Move existing components to appropriate directories
# Global components
mv app/components/Header.tsx app/components/global/
mv app/components/Footer.tsx app/components/global/
mv app/components/PageLayout.tsx app/components/global/
mv app/components/Aside.tsx app/components/global/

# Product components
mv app/components/ProductForm.tsx app/components/product/
mv app/components/ProductImage.tsx app/components/product/
mv app/components/ProductPrice.tsx app/components/product/
mv app/components/AddToCartButton.tsx app/components/product/
mv app/components/CartLineItem.tsx app/components/product/
mv app/components/CartMain.tsx app/components/product/
mv app/components/CartSummary.tsx app/components/product/

# UI components
touch app/components/ui/Button.tsx
touch app/components/ui/Card.tsx
touch app/components/ui/Modal.tsx
```

### Step 2: Create Creators Directory
```bash
# Create creators directory structure
mkdir -p app/creators/creator1/components
mkdir -p app/creators/creator1/styles
mkdir -p app/creators/creator1/assets

mkdir -p app/creators/creator2/components
mkdir -p app/creators/creator2/styles
mkdir -p app/creators/creator2/assets
```

### Step 3: Create Creator Routes
```bash
# Create creator routes
mkdir -p app/routes/creators
touch app/routes/creators/_index.tsx
touch app/routes/creators/[handle].tsx
mkdir -p app/routes/creators/[handle]/collections
touch app/routes/creators/[handle]/collections/_index.tsx
touch app/routes/creators/[handle]/collections/[collectionHandle].tsx
mkdir -p app/routes/creators/[handle]/products
touch app/routes/creators/[handle]/products/[productHandle].tsx
```

### Step 4: Create Creator Configuration
```bash
# Create creator management utilities
mkdir -p app/lib/creators
touch app/lib/creators/config.ts
touch app/lib/creators/types.ts
touch app/lib/creators/hooks.ts
```

## Phase 2: Component Implementation

### Step 1: Create Base UI Components
Implement the following base UI components:
- Button (app/components/ui/Button.tsx)
- Card (app/components/ui/Card.tsx)
- Modal (app/components/ui/Modal.tsx)

### Step 2: Refactor Global Components
Update imports in global components to reflect new directory structure.

### Step 3: Implement Creator Configuration System
In app/lib/creators/config.ts, implement creator configuration loading and management.

### Step 4: Create Component Override System
Implement a system that allows creator-specific components to override global components when needed.

## Phase 3: Route Implementation

### Step 1: Create Creator Listing Page
Implement app/routes/creators/_index.tsx to display a list of all creators.

### Step 2: Implement Creator Profile Page
Implement app/routes/creators/[handle].tsx to show a creator profile and their collections.

### Step 3: Creator Collections and Products
Implement routes for creator-specific collections and products.

## Phase 4: Asset Management

### Step 1: Set Up Public Directory Structure
```bash
# Create public directory structure
mkdir -p public/fonts
mkdir -p public/images
mkdir -p public/shared-assets
mkdir -p public/creators
```

### Step 2: Add Creator-Specific Assets
Upload creator logos, banners, and other assets to public/creators/[handle]/.

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing

### Step 1: Connect to Shopify Backend
Configure the Hydrogen storefront API to fetch creator-specific data.

### Step 2: Test Creator Subpages
Test each creator's collections and products to ensure proper routing and data display.

### Step 3: Implement Global Navigation
Update the navigation to include creator browsing and discovery.

## Phase 6: Optimization and Deployment

### Step 1: Optimize for Performance
Implement proper code splitting for creator-specific components and routes.

### Step 2: SEO Configuration
Configure SEO metadata for creator pages, collections, and products.

### Step 3: Deploy to Oxygen
Deploy the finished site to Shopify's Oxygen hosting platform.
