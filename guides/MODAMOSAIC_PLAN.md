# ModaMosaic Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
ModaMosaic is a multi-creator marketplace platform where different creators can sell their own collections through a unified brand experience.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Directory Structure Adaptation
We'll adapt the existing Hydrogen template to follow the requested structure:

```
/
├── public/                   # Static assets (shared across all sites)
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
│   └── shared-assets/
├── app/                      # Main application code (aligned with Hydrogen convention)
│   ├── components/           # Shared components
│   │   ├── global/           # Used across all creator sites
│   │   ├── product/          # Product-related components 
│   │   └── ui/               # UI primitives
│   ├── creators/             # Creator-specific components and styles
│   │   ├── creator1/
│   │   ├── creator2/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── routes/               # Route definitions (keep existing + add creator routes)
│   │   └── creators/         # Creator sub-sites
│   │       └── [handle]/     # Dynamic creator pages
│   ├── styles/               # Global styles
│   └── lib/                  # Utilities and helpers
│       └── creatorConfig.js  # Creator configuration
```
